AR-VR Implementation:

• Implement AR-VR functionality within the Flutter app to overlay an
emoji or sticker over a user's face. Ensure the overlay only covers the
face area.
• Optimize the code for performance, ensuring a good frame per
second (FPS) on the camera screen page.

Flutter Setup
1. Just clone the code into system and it is ready to use.
Ps: Make sure the app will not run on the emulator as it requires the real camera to work.
